1.1.2
Begun work on making this online tool encrypted. 
Corrected bug where version numbers did not display correctly with pwsh.

1.1.1
Begun work on the backup ticket button. the initial backup ticket launcher works and the "archive CSV" button works as well.

1.1.0
Added linking function to notes page to match desktop version.
To make a link clickable from your notes results page when you do a search, simply include TWO asterisk symbols to the start or end of the link when adding the link to the page using the add note button.

1.0.9
Added functionality to the Add notes button.

1.0.8
Fixed the permissions in the settings menu to match the change made on the desktop version 1.5.5
Here are the notes from that update:
Fixed bug where permissions could build up extra new lines at the end of the file causing permissions to fail to show after adding permissions to check for. - now when you edit the permissions, it double checks everything and removes any extra lines from the end of the file.
added automatic ipconfig /flushdns to launch script if ping fails.

1.0.7
Fixed change log button to display accurately. 
Fixed installer so it works completely out of the appdata folder and doesn't create launchers anywhere else
Fixed launcher so that it doesn't need a launcher.ps1 file to work
Fixed laumcher so it references the .ico file in the appdata folder rather than having to make a new folder on the C:\ drive.
