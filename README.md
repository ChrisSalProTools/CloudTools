# CloudTools
This is a web based project. Using the commands Invoke-WebRequest and Invoke-Expression, I can effectively pull the needed powershell code from this repo and then run it on any computer I need it to run on. 
I've already completed a desktop version of this tool which I will begin to stop releasing updates for - it seems fairly complete with what I want to do with it. 
Using this new method of running the tool, you will never have to update ITSDProTools again - it will always get the newest version next time you run the program. 
As for right now, the tool doesn't do much. it displays a gui, but by the time I'm done with it, I will discontinue the desktop app and switch soley to this version of the program.
