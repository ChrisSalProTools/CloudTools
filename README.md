# CloudTools
This is a web based project. Using the commands Invoke-WebRequest and Invoke-Expression, I can effectively pull the newest and most up to date code and run it on whichever computer is making the pull request.
I've already completed a desktop version of this tool which will be slowly phased out. Eventually I want anyone using the desktop version to switch to this version as this will get the newest updates.  
Using this new method of running the tool, you will never have to update ITSDProTools again. It will always get the newest version next time you run the program. 
As of right now, this is extremely early dev software. As I port more and more features over, the desktop tool will be phased out.
